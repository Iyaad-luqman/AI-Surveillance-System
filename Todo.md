Using https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip process video files for violence detection or car fire or whatever. 


Frame Skipping: Instead of processing every frame in the video, you can process every nth frame. This will significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed, but it may miss important frames.

Parallel Processing: Use multiple cores or multiple machines to process the video in parallel. This can significantly reduce the processing time, but it requires more resources and more complex code.

The @torch.no_grad() decorator is used to disable gradient calculations during the forward pass, which can save memory when you only need to do a forward pass (like during inference).

[x] Try to get the app working open_clip
	
	It basically uses transformers and then goes to settings.yaml, fetches the classification from there, tries to get the threshold and then matches with one and then alerts the prediction.

[x] Try support for video from the jupyter notebook code,
[x] If the video duration provided by dictionary is 3,it increases the time by including more content to it.
[ ] Add support where the user gives the context its looking for and only try to detect form it.
[ ] Try to get the timeframe of it and take a screenshot and save it. 
[ ] NLP process using nlp_interpreter and take the user_input and parse it out for violence classification
[ ] Create a Web app where there is option for selecting which process_engine to run it on.
	
	- Maybe try JS Framworks with Beautiful default compnents and tell the the AI tool to write the code.
	[] 	Use tailwind css for the UI
	Generate a JS SAAS Web application which uses Beautiful component UI Libraries, tailwind CSS, and gives a modern reactive and aesthetic look. Use the attached image for design theme and ideas and use a framwork you see fit. Give me the complete code for it. The website is for an AI Survillaince model which get input as a video as well as the question or the prompt the user wants to get.  It should contain the following page:
	1. Dashboard :
	This would contain like  Chatbot where you can pass in queries and a button for uploading video. If you click on advanced option, there be'll textboxes for inputting custom queries and a progress bar to alter the threshold and teprature. then it'll send to a API server. The reponse will be in json and display all the elements like the timeframe details, the categories of violence and what time it happend, also it'll display a text in big which will show a summary of alll the answers. While its waiting for the reponse, show some cool loading wave animation. THE UI should be very modern and elegant. 
	2. Saved Analysis:
	this would contain a list of the previous tests that ran and user asked to save it. it should display all the required information too by requestion a json,
	3. Settings:
	It should have an option for switching between gemini and ollama and providing api keys for them . 
	ChatGPT


[ ] Add a UI Where it shows the screenshot along with timeframes.
[ ] Add GPU OR CPU Option in settings
[ ] Add a option for searching person with cap or person with red shirt
[ ] For large video files, tell the user when in IST the video start playing, and then the user can ask queries like car crash between 7pm and 8pm, so that it trims those videos specifically and then analyses that part of the code alone
